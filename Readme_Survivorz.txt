This is where I tell you how to install this mod and the proper settings for it.
However, I don't feel like writing that right now, so deal with it.

Special Thanks to:
  - Dioxine for the current name of the mod, and for ideas on worldbuilding.
    Probably some sprites too that I haven't stolen yet.
  - Solarius Scorch for letting me bounce ideas off of him, and for sprites to
    gank.
  - Meridian for OXCE+ and including my code in his repository
